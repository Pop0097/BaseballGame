# Baseball_Game

In this program, the user gets to control a baseball game, which – in this program – consists of three innings (plus any extras to break a tie). The user decides on the results of each bat, stating if it is a single, double, triple, or a home run. The program tracks the positions of each player and determines the winner of the game at the end.
